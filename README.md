# Power-BI-Visual---Hospitality-Domain
The hospitality industry thrives on exceptional experiences. But how do we measure that magic touch and translate it into sustainable success? Here's where Business Intelligence (BI) steps in, empowering us to unlock valuable insights from a treasure trove of hospitality metrics.

In my recent portfolio project, Iâ€™ve dived deep into this domain, tried to understand the metrics that matter & visualized the data to demonstrate the trends in play. I have taken the data from the Codebasics site. This data belongs to a hotel chain that has multiple hotels in multiple cities. For Dataviz, I have used Microsoft Power BI.
Here Iâ€™ll discuss the key metrics & explain each visual Iâ€™ve used in this visualization.

ðŸš€ Metrics that Matter
Occupancy %: This is the percentage of total successful bookings to the number of available rooms.
Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): A key performance indicator (KPI) that reflects our ability to fill rooms at profitable rates. RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied.
Average Daily Rate (ADR): ADR is the average amount of money a hotel earns per occupied room in a specific period (day, month, year). It's calculated by dividing the total room revenue by the number of rooms sold.
Realisation %: It is nothing but the successful â€˜checked outâ€™ percentage over all the bookings that happened.
Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN): This metric tells us within a period, how many rooms are booked per day. Itâ€™s calculated by dividing the total booked rooms by the number of days within the period of concern
Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN): This metric tells us within a period, how many rooms are ready to be booked per day. We need to know the capacity of a hotel to calculate this.
Daily Utilized Room Nights (DBRN): This metric tells us within a period, how many rooms are successfully used by customers per day. This is important because all bookings are not successful at the end. This metric is taken into account to calculate the profit.

ðŸš€ Power BI Visualization
Slicer (Dropdown): In the top left, Iâ€™ve used 2 slicers to filter the data based on city & room types
Slicer (Tile): I have used 2 slicers (Tile) to enable the user to filter the data both monthly & weekly
Donut Chart: The Donut chart in the top-left segregates the data based on luxury & business rooms. The user can compare the percentage here with this
Line & Stacked Column Chart: Here the user can observe the trend of ADR & Realisation % across multiple booking platforms
Line Chart: This chart shows the trend of key metrics (RevPar. ADR. Occupancy %) across both weeks & months. The user can drill down here to check the trend more specifically as per our requirement
Table: Lastly, all our data are tabulated so that the user can check them at a glance.
